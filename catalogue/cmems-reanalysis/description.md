The Global Ocean Reanalysis product is the CMEMS global ocean eddy-resolving (1/12Â° horizontal
resolution, 50 vertical levels) reanalysis covering the altimetry (1993 onward).


This product includes daily and monthly mean files for temperature, salinity, 
currents, sea level, mixed layer depth and ice parameters from the top to the 
bottom.

We propose a subset of the data for daily means and selected variables.
