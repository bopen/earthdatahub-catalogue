The Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis is the CMEMS global ocean eddy-resolving (1/12° horizontal resolution, 50 vertical levels) reanalysis covering the altimetry (1993 onward).


We propose daily mean files for world sea bottom temperature, sea level, mixed layer depth and ice parameters from 1993 t0 2020.

The  output data are displayed on a standard regular grid at 1/12° (approximatively 8 km) as zarr archives.

Data are free for access for DestinE Service Platform registered users.
