title: ECMWF Open Data High-resolution Forecasts
description:
  The High-Resolution forecasts (HRES) is a model single run created twice a day giving 10 days forecasts
  based on 00UTC and 12UTC data times.


  The HRES (current resolution 9km) provides
  a more detailed description of future weather than individual member
  of the ENS. When performance is assessed using many forecasts it provides, on average.
  the most accurate single-run realisation of the broadscale weather patterns.


  However, any individual HRES forecast may not be the most skilful compared to ENS member
  forecasts, and when viewed in isolation it cannot provide an estimate of forecast
  uncertainty or confidence.


  It is most useful to think of HRES as a member of
  the ENS forecast ensemble, since it contains the same physical and dynamical representation
  of the atmosphere and uses the same parameterisation of sub-gridscale effects.


  HRES has the advantage of higher resolution, greater detail of orography, and better discrimination
  of land-sea differences than ENS. Typical HRES weighting for surface variables
  is such that HRES is worth 15-20 ENS members at Day1 and around 5 ENS members
  at Day10.  However, well above the surface, the HRES advantage over ENS is less
  significant and HRES weighting is likely to be significantly lower for forecast
  upper-air than for forecast surface variables since resolution and surface detail
  play a less significant role here.
