title: DestinE Climate Adaptation DT, activity story-nudging, experiment Tplus2.0K, model IFS-FESOM
dc:abstract:
  The DestinE Digital Twin for Climate Change Adaptation (Climate DT) supports adaptation activities 
  through the provision of innovative climate information on multi-decadal timescales, 
  at scales at which the impacts of climate change are observed. 
  This initiative presents the first ever attempt to operationalise the production of 
  global multi-decadal climate projections at km-scale resolutions of 5 to 10km.
