This dataset contains a selection of surface and single level fields derived 
from the DestinE Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin according to the 
output of the IFS-NEMO model coupled with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 
3-7.0 (SSP3-7.0) as defined in the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project 
(ScenarioMIP). Fields are regridded from the original HEALPix grid to a regular 
latitude-longitude grid and distributed with 0.044Â° spatial resolution and 
hourly temporal resolution. The chunking is optimised for time based and 
regional analysis.
