title: DestinE Climate Adaptation DT, activity ScenarioMIP, experiment SSP3-7.0, model IFS-NEMO
dc:abstract:
  The DestinE Digital Twin for Climate Change Adaptation (Climate DT) supports adaptation activities through the provision of innovative climate information on multi-decadal timescales, at scales at which the impacts of climate change are observed. This initiative presents the first ever attempt to operationalise the production of global multi-decadal climate projections at km-scale resolutions of 5 to 10km.
