The Copernicus DEM is a Digital Surface Model (DSM) that represents the surface of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure and vegetation. Data were acquired through the TanDEM-X mission between 2011 and 2015. The datasets were made available for use in 2019 and will be maintained until 2026.
  
  
  We propose a subset of the whole corpus of data based on the most popular datasets.
