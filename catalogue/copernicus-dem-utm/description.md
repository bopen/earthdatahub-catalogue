The Copernicus DEM is a Digital Surface Model (DSM) that represents
the surface of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure and vegetation.
Data were acquired through the TanDEM-X mission between 2011 and 2015.
The datasets were made available for use in 2019 and will be maintained until 2026 by Copernicus.

The Copernicus DEM is reprojected on a 20m by 20m grid in UTM / UPS zones
and cropped to the MGRS tiles used in the Sentinel-2 Level 2 products.
