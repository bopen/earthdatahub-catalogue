The Sentinel-1 mission is a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites, operating day and night performing C-band synthetic aperture radar imaging. The Sentinel-1 Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) data are Analisys Ready Data (ARD) derived from the Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level-1 products produced by the European Space Agency.

Radiometric Terrain Correction accounts for terrain variations that affect both the position of a given point on the Earth's surface and the brightness of the radar return, as expressed in radar geometry. Without treatment, the hill-slope modulations of the radiometry threaten to overwhelm weaker thematic land cover-induced backscatter differences. Additionally, comparison of backscatter from multiple satellites, modes, or tracks loses meaning.

We propose a subselection of Analisys Ready Data above Italy.
They are presented as a NetCDF / Zarr archive optimised for time analysis.
