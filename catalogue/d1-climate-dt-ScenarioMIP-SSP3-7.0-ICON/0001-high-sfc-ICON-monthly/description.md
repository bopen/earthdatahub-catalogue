This dataset contains a selection of surface and single level fields derived from the DestinE Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin according to the output of the ICON model coupled with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 (experiment: SSP3-7.0) as defined in the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (activity: ScenarioMIP). Fields are regridded from the original HEALPix grid to a regular latitude-longitude grid and distributed with 0.044Â° spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution. The chunking is optimised for time based and regional analysis.
