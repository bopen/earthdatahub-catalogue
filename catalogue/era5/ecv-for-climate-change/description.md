The [Essential Climate Variables for assessment of climate variability from 1979 to present](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Essential+Climate+Variables+for+assessment+of+climate+variability+from+1979+to+present%3A+Product+user+guide) dataset contains
a selection of monthly anomalies of
Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) suitable for monitoring and assessment of climate variability and change.

Here we propose a subset of the ECV world data for anomalies on soil water, two metre temperature and total precipitation, plus the sea-ice area fraction. The data are available from 1978 until the last closed month and updated monthly.

They are presented as a NetCDF / Zarr archive optimised for time analysis.
