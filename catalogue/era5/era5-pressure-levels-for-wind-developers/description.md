This dataset cointains the low altitude ERA5 pressure levels data
for world atmospheric quantities derived from [ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.bd0915c6).
The dataset is tailored for the analysis of off-shore wind farms sites
typically required by wind developers.

The data are available from 1940 until the last closed month and updated monthly and are regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees.

They are presented as a ARCO Zarr v3 archive optimised for time analysis.
