This dataset contains the low altitude ERA5 pressure levels data for world atmospheric quantities derived from [ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.bd0915c6). Only pressure levels 1000, 975 and 950 hPa are included. The dataset is tailored for the analysis of offshore wind farm sites typically required by wind developers.
