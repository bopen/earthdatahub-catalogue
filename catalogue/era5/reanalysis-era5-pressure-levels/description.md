This is a subset of world atmospheric quantities derived from [ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.bd0915c6) dataset. The subset only includes pressure levels 1000, 925, 850, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 20, 10, 5, 1 [hPa]. 

Data are available from 1940 until the last closed month and updated monthly.

They are presented as a ARCO Zarr archive optimised for spatial analysis.
