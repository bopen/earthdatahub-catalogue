Here we propose a subset of ERA5 data for world atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities called [ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.bd0915c6). The data are available from 1940 until the last closed month and updated monthly and are regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees.

They are presented as a NetCDF / Zarr archive.
