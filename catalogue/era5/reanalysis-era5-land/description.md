ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables
over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5.

ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis.
Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past.

Here we propose ERA5 data for world land surface quantities called [ERA5-Land hourly data from 1950 to present](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac). The data are available from 1950 until the last closed month and updated monthly.

They are presented as a NetCDF / Zarr archive optimised for time analysis.
