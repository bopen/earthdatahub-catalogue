Here we propose a subset of ERA5 data for ocean-wave quantities belonging to [ERA5 hourly data on single levels](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.adbb2d47). The data are available from 1940 until the last closed month and updated monthly and are regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.5 degrees.

They are presented as a NetCDF / Zarr archive optimised for time analysis.
