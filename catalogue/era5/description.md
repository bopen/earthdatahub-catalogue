ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades.
Data is available from 1940 onwards on ECWMF [Copernicus Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).

ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.

We propose a subset of the whole corpus of data based on the most popular datasets and variables. Specifically speaking ERA5 Land, ERA5 Single Levels, ERA5 pressure level and Essential Climate Variables (ECV) on selected variables. Furthermore ERA5 monthly data on single level have been added.

Datasets are presented as as a NetCDF / Zarr archive optimised specifically for time analysis and covering the whole available geographical and temporal extent of the original data. Also, resolution is preserved and data are updated until the last closed month with monthly updates.

Please refer to the specific datasets for detailed information about extent, resolution, updates and access rights.
