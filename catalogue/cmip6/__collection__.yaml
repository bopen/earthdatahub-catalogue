title: CMIP6, activity ScenarioMIP, model EC-Earth3-CC, experiment SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 
dc:abstract:
  AThe Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that provides multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. Here we propose datasets from the 
  EC-Earth3-CC model.
