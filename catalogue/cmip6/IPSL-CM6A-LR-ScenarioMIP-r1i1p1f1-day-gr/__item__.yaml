      description: The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.
        "Upward" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward
        (negative downward). The surface latent heat flux is the exchange of heat
        between the surface and the air on account of evaporation (including sublimation).
        In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies
        per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.

        "Upward" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward
        (negative downward). The surface sensible heat flux, also called "turbulent"
        heat flux, is the exchange of heat between the surface and the air by motion
        of air. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux"
        implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics. Unless indicated
        in the cell_methods attribute, a quantity is assumed to apply to the whole
        area of each horizontal grid box. Previously, the qualifier where_type was
        used to specify that the quantity applies only to the part of the grid box
        of the named type.  Names containing the where_type qualifier are deprecated
        and newly created data should use the cell_methods attribute to indicate the
        horizontal area to which the quantity applies.

      description: The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.
        "shortwave" means shortwave radiation. Upwelling radiation is radiation from
        below. It does not mean "net upward". When thought of as being incident on
        a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called "irradiance". In addition,
        it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter
        and sometimes called "vector irradiance". In accordance with common usage
        in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density"
        in physics.
