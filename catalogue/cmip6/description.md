The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) represents the latest global collaboration of climate modelling groups, serving as the scientific foundation for the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report. It standardizes model execution to ensure that scientific results can be compared consistently across different countries. The project provides multi-model climate projections spanning 2015 to 2100, based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes. These scenarios range from sustainable, low-emission pathways to high-forcing fossil-fueled development, allowing for the assessment of climate risks and variability across multiple plausible futures. Additionally, CMIP6 distributes historical simulations (hindcasts) spanning the industrial era (typically 1850–2014) driven by observed time-varying external forcings. 
Here we present a curated collection of low-to-high resolution CMIP6 models, each containing a subset of selected variables. These datasets are distributed in Zarr v3 format, optimised for efficient time-series and regional analysis. 
Please refer to the specific datasets for detailed information regarding extent, resolution, experiments, and size.
