      description: The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.
        "Upward" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed upward
        (negative downward). The surface latent heat flux is the exchange of heat
        between the surface and the air on account of evaporation (including sublimation).
        In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies
        per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.

      description: The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere.
        "shortwave" means shortwave radiation. Upwelling radiation is radiation from
        below. It does not mean "net upward". When thought of as being incident on
        a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called "irradiance". In addition,
        it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter
        and sometimes called "vector irradiance". In accordance with common usage
        in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density"
        in physics.
