This dataset features a selection of future climate projections variables generated by the CESM2 Earth system model as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).

The data covers the future simulation period 2015–2100 and includes four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs):

SSP1-2.6: A low-emission "Sustainability" scenario emphasizing inclusive development and environmental stewardship, representing a pathway compatible with keeping global warming below 2°C.

SSP2-4.5: A "Middle-of-the-Road" scenario representing intermediate greenhouse gas emissions and historical patterns of development, with medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation.

SSP3-7.0: A high-emission "Regional Rivalry" scenario driven by resurgent nationalism and regional conflicts, resulting in slow economic growth and high challenges to both mitigation and adaptation.

SSP5-8.5: A very high-emission "Fossil-fueled Development" scenario driven by rapid, energy-intensive global growth, representing the upper boundary of plausible future pathways.

The data is distributed in a compressed Zarr format with near-zero precision loss. It features a daily temporal resolution and is structurally optimized for high-throughput regional assessments and time-series analysis.
