This dataset features a selection of future climate projections variables generated by the EC-Earth3-CC Earth system model as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).

The data covers the future simulation period 2015–2100 and includes two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs):

SSP2-4.5: A "middle-of-the-road" scenario representing intermediate greenhouse gas emissions and challenges to mitigation and adaptation.

SSP5-8.5: A high-emission "fossil-fueled development" scenario representing the upper boundary of plausible future pathways.

The data is distributed in a compressed Zarr format with near-zero precision loss. It features a daily temporal resolution and is structurally optimized for high-throughput regional assessments and time-series analysis.
