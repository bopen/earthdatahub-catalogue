This dataset features a selection of future climate projections variables generated by the MPI-ESM1-2-HR Earth system model as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).

The data covers the historical simulation period 1850–2014. Unlike future projections, this experiment utilizes observed time-varying external forcings to reconstruct the climate evolution of the industrial era.

The data is distributed in a compressed Zarr format with near-zero precision loss. It features a daily temporal resolution and is structurally optimized for high-throughput regional assessments and time-series analysis.
