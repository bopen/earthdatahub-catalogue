The CAMS reanalysis is the latest global reanalysis data set of atmospheric composition (AC) produced by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, consisting of 3-dimensional time-consistent AC fields, including aerosols, chemical species and greenhouse gases.

We propose a focus on long-lived greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) for all world between 2003 and 2020 with monthly resolution.
