DestinE Digital Twin for Weather-Induced Extremes (Extremes DT) supports rapid decision-making in response to meteorological, hydrological and air quality extremes. It currently comprises a global component, producing simulations at resolutions of a few kilometres up to four days ahead.

We propose a selection of the data available from the daily global forecast simulation from the IFS-NEMO model.
