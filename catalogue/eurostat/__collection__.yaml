  (EU), collects, compiles and publishes statistics for the
  EU and euro area, as well as national, regional and other
  subnational data, primarily for the EU Member States,

 Among the variuos statistics available on Eurostat, 
 we propose specific datasets with climate-related variables geoprocessed for easy correlation with other datasets.
