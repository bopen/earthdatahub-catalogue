description:
  Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union
  (EU), collects, compiles and publishes statistics for the
  EU and euro area, as well as national, regional and other
  subnational data, primarily for the EU Member States,
  but also for the EFTA and candidate countries.

  Eurostat shall be in charge of the development, production
  and dissemination of European statistics, in particular:
  (a) collect and aggregate the statistical information necessary
  to compile European statistics; (b) develop and promote
  statistical standards, methods and procedures; (c) steer the
  European Statistical System, strengthen cooperation among its
  partners, and ensure its leading role in official statistics
  worldwide; (d) cooperate with international organisations and
  third countries in order to facilitate the comparability of European
  statistics with statistics produced in other statistical systems
  and, where appropriate, support third countries in the improvement
  of their statistical systems.

  Eurostat shall ensure that European statistics are made accessible
  to all users in accordance with statistical principles, in particular
  the principles of professional independence, impartiality and statistical
  confidentiality. In this respect, Eurostat shall provide the technical
  explanations and the support necessary for the use of European statistics
  and may use appropriate communication channels for the purpose of
  statistical news releases.

  Eurostat shall ensure cooperation and regular constructive dialogue with
  other services of the Commission and, where necessary, with data providers
  with a view to taking into account user needs, relevant policy developments
  and other initiatives. To this end, those Commission services that are
  potential users of specific European statistics shall be informed and
  involved from an early stage in the development of new or changed
  statistics, among other things in order to understand the potential
  policy implications of new or changed statistical methods, standards
  and definitions.

  Eurostat shall coordinate the development and production of other
  statistics. For that purpose, it shall: (a) optimise the use of
  existing information that can be used for statistical purposes,
  in order to ensure quality and minimise burden for respondents;
  Eurostat shall invite any service of the Commission concerned to
  contribute for that purpose; (b) be informed by all services of
  the Commission about the scope and quality characteristics of
  statistics produced by them, about significant changes in the
  methodology for the production of statistics, and about new
  data collections planned; (c) provide guidance, appropriate
  training and expert services to other Commission services necessary
  for the development and production of other statistics, subject
  to available resources.
