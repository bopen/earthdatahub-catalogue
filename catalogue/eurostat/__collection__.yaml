  Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union
  (EU), collects, compiles and publishes statistics for the
  EU and euro area, as well as national, regional and other
  subnational data, primarily for the EU Member States,
  but also for the EFTA and candidate countries.

  Eurostat is in charge of the development, production
  and dissemination of European statistics and 
  ensures that European statistics are made accessible
  to all users in accordance with statistical principles.


 Among the variuos statistics available on Eurostat, 
 we propose specific datasets with climate-related variables geoprocessed for easy correlation with other datasets.
