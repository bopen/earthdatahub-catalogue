Each year Eurostat collects demographic data at regional level
from 37 countries as part of the Unified Demography (Unidemo)
project. UNIDEMO is Eurostat main annual demographic data
collection and aims to gather information on demography and
migration. UNIDEMO collects data at national and regional
levels by various breakdowns on population stocks;
vital events (live births and deaths); marriages; divorces;
and migration flows. Each country must send the statistics
for the reference year (T) to Eurostat by 31 December of
the following calendar year (T+1). Eurostat then publishes
the data in March of the calendar year after that (T+2).

Demographic data at regional level include statistics on the
population at the end of the calendar year and on live births
and deaths during that year, according to the official
classification for statistics at regional level
(NUTS - nomenclature of territorial units for statistics).
These data are broken down by NUTS 2 and 3 levels.
The current online demographic data refers to the NUTS
2016 classification, which subdivides the territory of
the European Union into 104 regions at NUTS level 1;
281 at NUTS level 2; and 1348 at NUTS level 3.
