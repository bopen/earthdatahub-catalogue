  dc:description:
    Heating degree day (HDD) index is a weather-based
    technical index designed to describe the need for
    the heating energy requirements of buildings.
    Cooling degree day (CDD) index is a weather-based
    technical index designed to describe the need for
    the cooling (air-conditioning) requirements of buildings.

    HDD and CDD are derived from meteorological observations
    of air temperature, interpolated to regular grids
    at 25 km resolution for Europe.
