Heating degree day (HDD) index is a weather-based
technical index designed to describe the need for
the heating energy requirements of buildings.
Cooling degree day (CDD) index is a weather-based
technical index designed to describe the need for
the cooling (air-conditioning) requirements of buildings.

HDD and CDD are derived from meteorological observations of air temperature, interpolated to regular grids
at 25 km resolution for Europe.
