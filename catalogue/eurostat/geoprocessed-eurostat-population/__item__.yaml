  dc:description:
    Each year Eurostat collects demographic data at regional level
    from 37 countries as part of the Unified Demography (Unidemo)
    project. UNIDEMO is Eurostatâ€™s main annual demographic data
    collection and aims to gather information on demography and
    migration. UNIDEMO collects data at national and regional
    levels by various breakdowns on population stocks;
    vital events (live births and deaths); marriages; divorces;
    and migration flows. Each country must send the statistics
    for the reference year (T) to Eurostat by 31 December of
    the following calendar year (T+1). Eurostat then publishes
    the data in March of the calendar year after that (T+2).

    Demographic data at regional level include statistics on the
    population at the end of the calendar year and on live births
    and deaths during that year, according to the official
    classification for statistics at regional level
    (NUTS - nomenclature of territorial units for statistics).
    These data are broken down by NUTS 2 and 3 levels.
    The current online demographic data refers to the NUTS
    2016 classification, which subdivides the territory of
    the European Union into 104 regions at NUTS level 1;
    281 at NUTS level 2; and 1348 at NUTS level 3.
