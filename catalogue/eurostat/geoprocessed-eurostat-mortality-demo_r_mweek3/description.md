In April 2020 Eurostat set up an exceptional data collection on total weekly deaths,
in order to support the policy and research efforts related to Covid-19.
With this data collection, Eurostat's target was to provide quickly statistics
that show the changing situation of the total number of weekly deaths from early 2020 onwards.
For a detailed description of the original EUROSTAT dataset see
[EUROSTAT metadata](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/demomwk_esms.htm).

The dataset available here is derived from the EUROSTAT dataset [demo_r_mweek3](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/product/view/demo_r_mweek3)
and provides a gridded spatial representation with a grid resolution of 0.1 degree.
