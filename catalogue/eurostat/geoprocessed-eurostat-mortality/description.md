In April 2020 Eurostat set up an exceptional data collection on
total weekly deaths, in order to support the policy and research
efforts related to Covid-19. With this data collection, Eurostat's
target was to provide quickly statistics that show the changing
situation of the total number of weekly deaths from early 2020 onwards.

The available data on the total weekly deaths are transmitted by
the National Statistical Institutes to Eurostat on voluntary basis.
Data are collected cross classified by sex, 5-year age-groups and
NUTS3 region (NUTS2021). The age breakdown by 5-year age group is
the most significant and should be considered by the reporting countries
as the main option, when that is not possible, data may be provided
with less granularity. Similar with the regional structure, data
granularity varies with the country.

Eurostat requested from the National Statistical Institutes the
transmission of a back time series of weekly deaths for as many year
as possible, recommending as starting point the year 2000. Shorter
time series, imposed by data availability, are transmitted by some
countries. A long enough time series is necessary for temporal
comparisons and statistical modelling.
