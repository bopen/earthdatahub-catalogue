Regional accounts are a regional specification of the national accounts and therefore based on the same concepts and definitions as national accounts (see domain nama10). The main specific regional issues are addressed in chapter 13 of ESA2010, but not practically specified. For practical rules and recommendations on sources and methods see the publication "Manual on regional accounts methods": http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/KS-GQ-13-001 .
Gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices is the final result of the production activity of resident producer units. In regional accounts it can be calculated from:

1. Output approach

   GDP is the sum of gross value added of the various institutional sectors or the various industries plus taxes and less subsidies on products (which are not allocated to sectors and industries). It is also the balancing item in the total economy production account.

1. Income approach

   GDP is the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account: compensation of employees plus gross operating surplus and mixed income plus taxes on products less subsidies plus consumption of fixed capital.
   Contrary to national accounts GDP is not compoled from the expenditure side in regional accounts due to data limitations on the inter-regional flows of goods and services.

The different measures for the regional GDP are absolute figures in â‚¬ and Purchasing Power Standards (PPS), figures per inhabitant and relative data compared to the EU Member States average.
