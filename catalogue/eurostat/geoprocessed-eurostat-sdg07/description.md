The indicator is part of the EU Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
indicator set. It is used to monitor progress towards SDG 7 on
affordable and clean energy, which is embedded in the European
Commission's Priorities under the 'European Green Deal'.

SDG 7 calls for ensuring universal access to modern energy services,
improving energy efficiency and increasing the share of
renewable energy. To accelerate the transition to an affordable,
reliable, and sustainable energy system, countries need to
facilitate access to clean energy research, promote investment
in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

The EU aims to improve energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020,
as set in the Europe 2020 strategy, and by at least 32.5 %
by 2030, according to the revised Energy Efficiency Directive.
The European Green Deal includes energy efficiency as a
key measure for reducing cross-sectoral GHG emissions.

The EU is implementing an interconnected set of measures
"Fit for 55" to reach the new climate targets for 2030
and has followed a new strategic plan REPowerEU to reduce
the EU dependency on energy imports. The European Green
Deal includes energy efficiency as a key measure for
reducing cross-sectoral GHG emissions. Energy efficiency
and Renewable energy Directives set ambitious EU targets
to be reached by 2030.
