title: Open Data Ensemble Forecasts
description:
  The Ensemble Forecast (ENS) is run twice a day producing 15 days forecasts based on 00UTC
  and 12UTC data times.

  The ENS consists of an ensemble of 51 forecasts (current
  spatial resolution 18km). It consists of a control member (CTRL) which is unperturbed
  and 50 perturbed members that are similar to the CTRL but their initial states and
  model physics have been perturbed to explore the currently understood range of uncertainty
  in the observations and the model.

  The ensemble members provide a range of possible
  future weather states. When averaged over many forecasts each of the perturbed
  members has lower skill than the CTRL (or, for that matter, HRES), though any individual
  forecast might show a higher skill.


  There is a range of products to present the
  information from the ensemble in different ways, appropriate for different uses
  including probabilities, clusters of alternative scenarios, and tropical cyclone
  and extra-tropical cyclone products. Certain important products are based on, or
  directly show, anomalies relative to the ENS model climate (M-climate), such as
  meteograms and the Extreme Forecast Index and Shift of Tails (EFI/SOT ).

  From these one can infer, for example, whether conditions (temperature, rainfall, etc.) are
  likely to deviate from the average for the location and time of year, and whether
  such an anomaly could be extreme.


  The ENS runs are extended at lower resolution
  on Mondays and Thursdays from Day15 to Day46 based on 00UTC data time (the extended
  range forecasts).
  Definitive information on the ECMWF dissemination schedule and products can be found in the the Catalogue of ECMWF real-time products.
